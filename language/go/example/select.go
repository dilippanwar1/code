// Goâ€™s select lets you wait on multiple channel operations. Combining
// goroutines and channels with select is a powerful feature of Go. A
// select blocks until one of its cases can run, then it executes that
// case. It chooses one at random if multiple are ready.

		time.Sleep(time.Second * 2)
